Week 1: Kubernetes, Docker, Networking, and Security
Goal: Build a strong foundation in Kubernetes, Docker, scripting, and security basics.

Daily Breakdown (4-6 hours/day):

Day 1: Kubernetes Basics (6 hours)
Learn: Kubernetes architecture (control plane, nodes, pods, services, deployments).
Resources: Kubernetes docs (kubernetes.io), FreeCodeCamp Kubernetes course (freecodecamp.org).
Practice: Install Minikube/Kind, deploy an Nginx pod using kubectl apply -f, expose it as a service, and access it.
Task: Document kubectl commands in your README.
