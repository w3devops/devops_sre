How the Plan Covers All DevOps/SRE Aspects
The plan addresses all core pillars of DevOps and SRE:

Automation: Python/Bash scripts, Argo Workflows.
CI/CD: Jenkins, ArgoCD, pipeline optimization.
IaC: Terraform, Kustomize, Helm.
Containerization/Orchestration: Docker, Kubernetes, Network Policies, RBAC.
Observability: Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Tempo, Jaeger, OpenTelemetry.
Reliability Engineering: SLOs, SLIs, error budgets, incident response.
Networking/Security: Istio mTLS, Secrets, Trivy, Network Policies.
Collaboration: Developer guides, runbooks, explaining concepts.
Cloud/Multicloud: AWS/EKS, GCP/GKE, Cloud SQL, cost optimization.
Chaos Engineering: LitmusChaos for resilience testing.
Performance Optimization: HPA, resource quotas.
Tooling/Ecosystem: CNCF tools (Fluentd, Linkerd), landscape exploration.
Team Dynamics: DevOps culture, collaboration scenarios.


Tips for Success
GitHub Repo: Maintain a clean, well-organized repo with the README as the central hub. Include scripts, manifests, and screenshots.
Troubleshooting: Practice debugging daily (e.g., kubectl logs, istioctl analyze) to build operational confidence.
Interview Prep: Use the capstone project to demonstrate hands-on skills. Prepare STAR-method stories for behavioral questions (e.g., resolving a production issue).
Community Engagement: Join CNCF Slack or X DevOps/SRE groups for support and updates (e.g., follow @kelseyhightower).
Time Management: Stick to 4-6 hours/day, use catch-up days for weak areas, and prioritize hands-on practice.
