Tips for Success
GitHub Repo: Maintain a clean, well-organized repo with the README as the central hub. Include scripts, manifests, and screenshots.
Troubleshooting: Practice debugging daily (e.g., kubectl logs, istioctl analyze) to build operational confidence.
Interview Prep: Use the capstone project to demonstrate hands-on skills. Prepare STAR-method stories for behavioral questions (e.g., resolving a production issue).
Community Engagement: Join CNCF Slack or X DevOps/SRE groups for support and updates (e.g., follow @kelseyhightower).
Time Management: Stick to 4-6 hours/day, use catch-up days for weak areas, and prioritize hands-on practice.
